Individual leagues will be made up of 12 teams each.

Weeks 1-11 will involve each team playing a head-to-head against each and every team in their league.
  Example:
  Team 4 Schedule
    Week 1:  @ Team 8
    Week 2:  @ Team 5
    Week 3:  v Team 2
    Week 4:  @ Team 10
    Week 5:  v Team 7
    Week 6:  v Team 12
    Week 7:  v Team 1
    Week 8:  @ Team 3
    Week 9:  @ Team 11
    Week 10: v Team 6
    Week 11: @ Team 9

The top 4 teams from each league following Week 11 will advance to the league playoffs
  The method for determining the top 4 is as follows:
    1) Total Wins
    2) Total Points For
  No trades will be possible after 11:59pm on the Monday of Week 11

In Weeks 12-14, the lowest weekly Points For among those remaining will be eliminated from contention
  Example:
  Week 12:
    Team 2:  174 pts
    Team 5:  149 pts (eliminated)
    Team 10: 180 pts
    Team 11: 161 pts
  Week 13:
    Team 2:  114 pts (eliminated)
    Team 10: 163 pts
    Team 11: 141 pts
  Week 14:
    Team 10: 146 pts (eliminated)
    Team 11: 153 pts
  Therefore, Team 11 advances to the Championship

Weeks 15-16 denote the Championship
  A two-week Points For total will determine the winner amongst the league playoff winners
