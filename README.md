###### Note: Individual leagues will be made up of 12 teams each.

#### Weeks 1-11

    - Week 10: v Team 6
    - Week 11: @ Team 9
- The top 4 teams from each league following Week 11 will advance to the league playoffs.

    - Team 2:  174 pts
    - ~~Team 5:  149 pts~~
    - Team 10: 180 pts
    - Team 11: 161 pts
